## 2.0.0 Breaking Changes

- SMTP, oauth settings and license key are now configured directly in windmill in the
  superadmin settings -> instance settings. They are propagated automatically and without requiring a restart. After update, set them directly in the superadmin settings.
- worker configuration has been unified to be all using worker groups. The
  default values include the "default" and "native" worker groups. Those have a
  default configuration in windmill that make them accept respetively "all jobs
  except native ones" and "only native jobs". It is likely that your values.yaml
  will need to migrate to this new setup, in particular, you should have a `windmill.workerGroups` block.

## Install

> Have Helm 3 [installed](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install).

```sh
helm repo add windmill https://windmill-labs.github.io/windmill-helm-charts/
helm install mywindmill windmill/windmill -n windmill --create-namespace --values values.yaml
```

To update versions:

```
helm repo update windmill
helm upgrade mywindmill windmill/windmill -n windmill --values values.yaml
```

You do not need to provide a values.yaml to be able to test it on minikube.
Follow the steps below.

### When using a non super-user role for postgresql in databaseUrl

You will need to setup some required roles which would otherwise be done
automatically when using a super-user role for the databaseUrl.

Follow those
[instructions](https://docs.windmill.dev/docs/advanced/self_host#run-windmill-without-using-a-postgres-superuser)

### Test it on minikube

To make it work on a local minkube to test. Get the ip address of the ingress:

```
▶ kubectl get ingress -n windmill
NAME       CLASS    HOSTS                        ADDRESS        PORTS   AGE
windmill   <none>   windmill,windmill,windmill   192.168.49.2   80      13m
```

If not ip address is displayed, enable the ingress addon:

```
minikube addons enable ingress
```

Then modify /etc/hosts to match the `baseDomain`, by default 'windmill'.

E.g:

```
192.168.49.2   windmill
```

Then open your browser at <http://windmill>

Even if you setup oauth, login as **admin@windmill.dev**:**changeme** to setup the instance & accounts and give yourself admin privileges.

## Local S3

The chart includes a Minio S3 distribution to demonstrate the usage of S3 as a
resource in a vendor-agnostic environment like Kubernetes. The local Minio S3
service will be available to the Windmill workers through its Kubernetes
service, which is set to "windmill-minio" by default. In the Resources page, you
should create an S3 API Connection Object, and import it as a connection object
to reduce code duplication between scripts. For the sake of this example, this
stage is skipped. Below is an example of how to authenticate and use the
provided local S3 distribution in a Python script running in Windmill:

```python
from minio import Minio

def main():
    # Create a client with the MinIO server, its access key
    # and secret key.
    client = Minio(
        "windmill-minio", # Local Kubernetes Service
        access_key="windmill",
        secret_key="windmill",
    )

    # Make 'demo' bucket if not exist.
    found = client.bucket_exists("demo")
    if not found:
        client.make_bucket("demo")
    else:
        print("Bucket 'demo' already exists")

    with open('readme.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('Create a new text file!')

    client.fput_object(
        "demo", "readme.txt", "readme.txt",
    )

    print(
        "'readme.txt' is successfully uploaded as "
        "object 'readme.txt' to bucket 'demo'."
    )
```

## Enterprise features

To use the enterprise version with the <license key> provided upon subscription,
add the following to the values.yaml file:

```
enterprise:
  enabled: true
```

Then go to the superadmin settings -> instance settings -> license key and set your license key

### S3 Cache

Enterprise users can use S3 storage for dependency caching for performance reasons at high scale (use only with #workers > 20).
Cache is two way synced at regular intervals (10 minutes). To use it, the worker
deployment requires access to an S3 bucket. There are several ways to do this:

1. On AWS (and EKS) , you can use a service account with IAM roles attached. See
   [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/associate-service-account-role.html) -
   once you have a policy , you can create an account via eksctl for instance

   ```sh
   eksctl create iamserviceaccount --name serviceaccountname --namespace production --cluster windmill-cluster --role-name "iamrolename" \ --attach-policy-arn arn:aws:iam::12312315:policy/bucketpolicy --approve
   ```

2. Mount/attach a credentials file in `/root/.aws/credentials` of the worker
   deployment
3. Add environment variables for the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
   `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, via kube secrets.

The sync relies on rclone and uses its methods of authentication to s3 per
[Rclone documentation](https://rclone.org/s3/#authentication)

Then the values settings become:

```
enterprise:
  enabled: true
  enabledS3DistributedCache: true
  s3CacheBucket: mybucketname
```

## Caveats

- Postgres is included for demo purposes, it is a stateful set with a small
  volume claim applied. If you want to host postgres in k8s, there are better
  ways, or offload it outside your k8s cluster. Postgres can be disabled
  entirely in the values.yaml file.
- The postgres user/pass is currently not a secret/encrypted

## Kubernetes Hosting Tips

The helm chart does have an ingress configuration included. It's enabled by
default. The ingress uses the `windmill.baseDomain` variable for its hostname
configuration. Here are two example configurations for an AWS ALB and
nginx-ingress/cert-manager:

AWS ALB:

```yaml
windmill:
  baseDomain: "windmill.example.com"
  ...

ingress:
  className: "alb"
  annotations:
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/tags: Environment=dev,Team=test
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-type: ip
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/target-group-attributes: stickiness.enabled=true,stickiness.lb_cookie.duration_seconds=604800,stickiness.type=lb_cookie
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-attributes: idle_timeout.timeout_seconds=600
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: windmill
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.order: '10'
    alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: my-certificatearn
...
```

nginx ingress + cert-manager:

```yaml
windmill:
  baseDomain: "windmill.example.com"
  ...

ingress:
  className: "nginx"
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - "windmill.example.com"
      secretName: windmill-tls-cert
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/issuer: "letsencrypt-prod"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity: "cookie"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/affinity-mode: "persistent"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/session-cookie-name: "route"
...
```

There are many ways to expose an app and it will depend on the requirements of
your environment. If you don't want to use the included ingress and roll your
own, you can just disable it. Overall, you want the following endpoints
accessible included in the chart:

- windmill app on port 8000
- lsp application on port 3001
- metrics endpoints on port 8001 for the app and workers (ee only)

If you are using Prometheus and if the enterprise edition is enabled, you can
scrape the windmill-app-metrics service on port 8001 at /metrics endpoint to
gather stats about the Windmill application.
